to-do:

big question marks
  - email clients fetching images before actually openning it
  - attaching images before sent triggering  
    - potential solution: add a "email sent" column to email table which determines whether to log it or not

concerns:
  - making more calls to db than neccessary 
  - ugly code bruh
